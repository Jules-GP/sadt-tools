"""Run one tool from another tool's tests, without coupling them.

`tools/ALI` cannot be tested end to end without segmented meshes, and those
come from `tools/Crown_Seg`. Importing crownseg into ali would put the coupling
back that the split exists to remove -- and it could not work anyway, since the
two have different interpreters and irreconcilable dependency sets.

So this runs the other tool the way the SERVER runs it: as a subprocess, through
its own `.venv`, calling its `run()`. Nothing is shared at runtime. This package
is a **development dependency only** and must never appear in a tool's
`[project] dependencies`.

    from sadt_testkit import run_tool

    meshes = run_tool(
        "Crown_Seg",
        meshes=raw_scan,
        model=checkpoint,
        output_dir=tmp_path / "segmented",
    )
    run(scans=meshes, model=..., output_dir=tmp_path / "landmarks")

It has no dependencies of its own, on purpose: a dev dependency that dragged in
a version of anything could perturb the resolution of the tool it is helping to
test, which is the one thing this repository must not let happen.
