"""ASO -- Automated Standardized Orientation.

Ported from the Slicer extension's `ASO/` module and its four CLI modules
(`ASO_CBCT/{PRE,SEMI}_ASO_CBCT`, `ASO_IOS/{PRE,SEMI}_ASO_IOS`). One tool, two
engines, four modes:

|            | Semi-Automated                        | Fully-Automated                       |
|------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **CBCT**   | landmarks you send, ICP onto a gold   | landmarks predicted first (see        |
|            | landmark set                          | `_predict_landmarks`), then the same  |
|            |                                       | ICP                                   |
| **IOS**    | landmarks you send, ICP per jaw       | tooth centroids of an already         |
|            |                                       | segmented mesh, ICP per jaw           |

The Slicer envelope is gone entirely: no `<filter-progress>` prints, no
`time.sleep` progress theatre, no `sys.exit`, no log file the client polls, no
`*Error.txt` beside the results, and nothing written into the caller's input
tree.

**Fully-automated CBCT calls another tool, and calls it from the middle.** The
landmark tool runs on the RECENTRED scans -- that is what the Slicer chain did,
`PRE_ASO_CBCT` before `ALI_CBCT` -- so it cannot be run before ASO and its
result handed in. The recentring is a pure metadata change, so it *ought* to be
reorderable, and it very nearly is; `ALI`'s `physical_position` takes the
absolute value of the origin, which does not commute with moving it (see issue
#11). Rather than bet on that, the order is kept exactly as it was and the
landmark tool is reached through the supervisor, at the point it always ran.

`sup` is keyword-only and unannotated, which is what marks it as the supervisor
rather than an argument: `describe.py` keeps it out of the schema, and a client
never sends it. It is duck-typed -- nothing here imports a supervisor type,
because doing so would need a package shared with the server, which is the
coupling this repository exists to remove.
