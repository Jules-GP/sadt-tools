"""ASO -- Automated Standardized Orientation.

Orients CBCT volumes or intra-oral meshes onto a reference frame. The pipeline
is in dispatch.py; only `run` is public.

One tool, two engines, four modes. Fully-automated CBCT needs landmarks it does
not place itself, and it needs them **mid-pipeline** -- after recentring, which
is the space the landmark tool was always run in. So it either receives them
(`landmarks`) or reaches the tool that makes them through the supervisor, at
the point in the run where it has always been called.

    """Orient CBCT scans or intra-oral scans onto a standard reference frame.

    Args:
        input: One scan (.nii/.nii.gz/.nrrd/.nrrd.gz/.gipl/.gipl.gz), one
            intra-oral mesh (.vtk/.stl), or a folder of either for a batch.
            Folders are searched recursively and the output keeps their tree.
            In Semi-Automated mode the landmark files (.mrk.json) travel beside
            the scans, paired by name.
        reference: The already-oriented case defining the target frame — its
            landmark file for CBCT, its landmarks and meshes for IOS.
        output_dir: Where results are written — per patient, the oriented scan,
            its landmarks and the transform (.tfm) — plus `ASO_report.json`.
            Nothing is written outside it.
        modality: CBCT volumes or intra-oral surface scans. Never inferred from
            the file extension: a folder can hold either, and guessing wrong
            means orienting a patient against the wrong reference and calling
            it a success.
        automation: Semi-Automated registers on landmarks you send.
            Fully-Automated predicts CBCT landmarks first, and orients IOS
            meshes from the tooth labels they already carry.
        landmarks: Optional folder of landmark files (.mrk.json) to use instead
            of the ones beside the scans — which is what makes Fully-Automated
            CBCT work with no supervisor: run the landmark tool yourself and
            pass its output here. Paired to scans by name, like the ones in the
            input tree.
        landmark_models: The model bundle the landmark tool predicts with.
            Required by Fully-Automated CBCT when the landmarks are not
            supplied, and ignored otherwise.
        cbct_landmarks: CBCT only. Which landmarks to register on; at least 3,
            and they must exist in the reference. The default seven are the
            points both published reference bundles are built on.
        ios_teeth: IOS only. Which teeth to register on. Fully-Automated aligns
            each jaw from 3 or 4 spread across the arch.
        ios_landmark_types: IOS Semi-Automated only. Combined with `ios_teeth`
            into `<tooth><type>` keys, e.g. UR6 x O -> UR6O.
        ios_jaws: IOS only. Which jaws to orient.
        ios_occlusion: IOS only. Whether each jaw is oriented on its own, or one
            jaw's transform is applied to the other so the occlusion is kept.
        dicom_input: CBCT only. Convert DICOM series found in the input to NIfTI
            before orienting.
        output_suffix: Added to each output name, e.g. `patient1_Or.nii.gz`.
        max_triplets: Landmark triplets the coarse alignment searches before
            running ICP. Lower is faster and less thorough; it changes the
            result, so the run report records it.
        seed: Seed for that search, so a run is reproducible.

    Returns:
        The output directory, holding the oriented cases and the run report.
