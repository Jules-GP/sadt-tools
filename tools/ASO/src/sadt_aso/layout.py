"""How a client should lay this tool's panel out. Presentation only.

Nothing here changes what `run()` accepts — `describe.py` merges these hints
into the published schema and refuses any that name an argument or an option
the signature does not offer. Delete this file and the tool still works; the
panel just gets worse.

ASO is the tool that needs this most, because its **four modes share one
schema**. Without `visible_when` a panel shows all 115 CBCT landmarks next to
all 32 teeth, whichever mode is selected, and a clinician has to know which half
to ignore. The conditions below are the old Slicer module's four-page
`QStackedWidget` expressed as data instead of as widget code.

**Everything is DERIVED, never restated** — the tabs come from `catalogs`, so a
landmark or a tooth added there appears in its tab with no edit here. That is
the difference from the `ArgSpec` tables this replaces, which listed options by
hand and drifted from the code they described.
