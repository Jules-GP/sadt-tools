    """Segment craniofacial structures on a CBCT scan.

    Args:
        scans: One oriented CBCT scan (.nii/.nii.gz/.nrrd/.nrrd.gz/.gipl/
            .gipl.gz), or a folder of them for a batch. Folders are searched
            recursively, and files that look like a previous AMASSS output are
            skipped so a folder can be re-run in place.
        model: The model bundle: one subfolder per structure code (MAND/, MAX/,
            ...), each holding an nnUNet v2 model.
        output_dir: Where results are written -- one `<scan>_<ID>_SegOut/`
            folder per scan, plus `AMASSS_report.json`. Nothing is written
            outside it.
        structures: Structure codes to segment: MAND (mandible), MAX (maxilla),
            CB (cranial base), CV (cervical vertebra), UAW (upper airway),
            SKIN, and the three masks CBMASK, MANDMASK, MAXMASK. The display
            names the old schema published ("Cranial base", ...) are accepted
            too. A structure with no model in the bundle is reported in
            `structures_without_model` rather than failing the run.
        merge: MERGED for one multi-label file per scan, SEPARATE for one
            binary file per structure. Both may be given. A single-structure
            run always writes the separate form -- a "merged" volume of one
            structure is just that structure.
        prediction_ID: Suffix used in output names, e.g. `scan_Pred_MAND.nii.gz`.
        generate_surface: Also export a 3D surface (.vtk) beside each
            segmentation.
        surface_smoothing: Smoothing iterations for the surfaces (0-95).
            Ignored without generate_surface.
        surface_decimation: Percentage of surface triangles to drop (0-99).
            Marching cubes runs on the original scan grid, so a 0.33 mm CBCT
            gives a triangle per voxel face -- 3.5 M across a five-structure
            run -- for detail the mask does not have, being accurate to about
            half a voxel. 90 drops nine triangles in ten and moves the
            cranial-base surface by 0.059 mm on average (max 0.692 mm); 0 keeps
            the raw mesh. Ignored without generate_surface.
        device: "cuda" or "cpu". CUDA falls back to CPU when no card is
            visible, with a warning.
        tile_step_size: nnUNet's sliding-window overlap; the window advances by
            patch_size times this. It DOES move the segmentation (0.7 measures
            Dice 0.995 against 0.5), so it is left at nnUNet's own default.
        gpu_resampling: Resample on the GPU instead of nnUNet's scipy splines.
            Roughly seven times less time in resampling, which is where a run
            actually goes. Ignored on CPU and for a bundle whose plans pin a
            non-default resampler. Set false for bit-identical nnUNet output.

    Returns:
        The output directory, holding one folder per scan plus the run report.
