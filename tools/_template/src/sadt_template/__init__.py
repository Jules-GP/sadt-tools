"""Reference tool package: copy this directory to start a new tool.

The whole public surface of a tool is the single callable `run` below. Nothing
else here is part of the contract -- no base class to subclass, no registry to
edit, no import from the server. The server's runner imports this module and
calls `run(**params)`; `scripts/describe.py` reads the same signature to publish
the tool's JSON schema. Signature and schema therefore cannot drift.

What this placeholder computes (intensity statistics over `.npy` arrays) is not
the point and is meant to be deleted. The five rules it demonstrates are:

1. Stdlib annotations only -- `Path`, `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`,
   `Literal[...]` and `list[...]` of those. describe.py refuses anything else
   rather than guess, so an `Optional[int]` or a custom marker type fails the
   build instead of shipping a wrong schema to the client.
2. No default means required. That is the *only* place `required` comes from.
3. Batch input. `scans` takes a directory as readily as one file: the server
   pays a process start-up cost per call, so a folder of 40 scans must be one
   call, not 40.
4. Heavy imports live INSIDE run(). describe.py imports this module in every CI
   job; a module-level `import torch` would make schema generation cost a CUDA
   stack and fail on a machine that has none.
5. Everything written goes under `output_dir`, which the caller owns.
6. An argument with a fixed set of options says so with `Literal[...]`, and
   describe.py publishes them as `choices` for the client to render as a
   picker. `list[Literal[...]]` is several-of, a bare `Literal[...]` is
   exactly-one -- the old schema's "multichoice" and "choice". Saying it in the
   annotation is the point: a separate table of options drifts from the code,
   which is what the `ArgSpec.choices` it replaces used to do.
7. Nothing here unpacks a `.zip`. The server unpacks archives before `run()`
   is called, so a tool always receives a real file or directory.

    Args:
        scans: One `.npy` array, or a folder of them for a batch.
        output_dir: Where results are written. Nothing is written outside it.
        metrics: Statistics to compute. Several may be chosen.
        reduction: Whether to report one row per scan or one row for the batch.
        threshold: Ignore voxels at or below this intensity.
