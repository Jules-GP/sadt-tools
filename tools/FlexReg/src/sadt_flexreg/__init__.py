"""FlexReg: build a registration patch on an intraoral surface, and register on it.

Ported from `FlexReg_CLI.py` and the `FlexReg_Method/` package of
SlicerAutomatedDentalTools. Two arches are aligned on a REGION the clinician
chooses rather than on the whole mesh, because teeth move between timepoints and
the palate does not: registering on everything drags the result toward whatever
moved most.

What upstream had that this does not, and why:

- `curve` built a patch from a polyline drawn on the mesh in the 3D view. Its
  input is the stroke itself, so there is no form of it that does not include a
  Slicer scene; sending a mesh across the network per stroke is slower than the
  local pass it replaces.
- `delete` renamed `Butterfly<n+1>` down over `Butterfly<n>` and dropped the
  last. It is array bookkeeping with no computation in it, and a round trip to
  a server costs more than doing it.

Both stay in the Slicer module. What moved here is what needs a GPU or takes
real time: the butterfly patch, and the registration.

The GPU is not optional for the patch. Upstream's propagation calls `.cuda()`
with no availability test and no device argument, which is why the module ships
191 lines of `install_pytorch.py` to get torch into Slicer on a clinician's
laptop. Running it here is the point: the server has the card.

    Args:

        output_dir: Where the patched or registered surfaces are written.
        mode: Build the patch, register on a patch already there, or both.
        patch: Which region the registration is computed on. The palate is built
            from the four teeth below; the mucogingival line has to be present in
            the mesh already.
        reference: The surface the others are registered onto. Required to
            register, unused when only building a patch.
        tooth_anterior_right: Universal number of the anterior right tooth.
        anterior_right: Where that corner sits: ratio along the tooth (0 at
            mid-arch, 1 on the tooth) and millimetres fore or aft.
        tooth_anterior_left: Universal number of the anterior left tooth.

        output_suffix: Appended to each written file's name.
