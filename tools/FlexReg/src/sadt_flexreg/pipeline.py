"""Everything FlexReg does before and after the two engines.

Ported from `FlexReg_CLI.py`, whose `main()` was one function branching on a
`type` string over 23 flat parameters read off a Qt form. What is here is the
half that survives without Slicer: read a surface, build a patch on it or
register one surface onto another, write the result.

The coordinate flip is the thing to know. A `.vtk` on disk is LPS and Slicer
works in RAS, so upstream scaled every mesh by (-1, -1, 1) on read and never
undid it: the file it wrote back was RAS. That is invisible while both ends are
Slicer and wrong the moment anything else reads the result, so the flip is
applied on read and again on write, and the mesh that leaves is in the
convention it arrived in. The registration matrix is still reported in the
convention SimpleITK expects, which is what upstream's `flip @ M @ flip` did.
