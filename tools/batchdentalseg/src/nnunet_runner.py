"""nnUNet v2 inference for BatchDentalSeg, isolated from the pipeline.

The upstream widget drove nnUNet through `SlicerNNUNetLib.Parameter` and a
`QProcess`, which is why most of that file is process management: killing a
crashed inference tree, reclaiming stray workers, a RAM watchdog. None of it
applies here -- the Python API returns when it is done, and the server already
bounds concurrency (see `settings.MAX_CONCURRENT_TOOLS` and the semaphore
below).

AMASSS carries a near-identical module. They are deliberately separate copies:
`registry.py` imports every tool at startup, so importing another tool's module
would make one tool's missing dependency take both out of the registry. The
same reason ASO and AREG each carry their own dicom.py.

torch and nnunetv2 are imported lazily, so a deployment without them still
boots and only a BatchDentalSeg *run* fails, with a message naming what is
missing.
