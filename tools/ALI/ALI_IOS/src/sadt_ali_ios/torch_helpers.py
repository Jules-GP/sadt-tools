"""The two torch helpers both ALI engines need, and nothing else.

Duplicated from the CBCT engine's `brain.py` rather than shared, and the split
between the two is the point: `brain.py` also holds the deep-RL agent and the
monai DenseNet it walks the volume with. This engine uses monai too -- a 2D
UNet, in `engine.py` -- but a different network entirely, so importing
`brain.py` for two eleven-line guards would pull in the agent as well.

`resolve_device`'s own docstring already said "shared by both engines" before
the split -- what it was NOT was shared through a package. These are eleven
lines of guard; a copy costs nothing and an import would couple two virtualenvs
pinned to different torch versions.
