"""ALI_CBCT -- Automatic Landmark Identification on CBCT volumes.

One deep-RL agent per landmark walks the volume at 1 mm and then at 0.3 mm
until it converges on the point. Writes one Slicer markups file per scan.

Split out of the former single `ALI` tool, which chose between this engine and
the intraoral one from the data. The two shared nothing but their output
format and their input vocabulary -- both now in `sadt_ali_common` -- while
being forced to share a virtualenv, and therefore a torch version. The
intraoral engine needs torch 2.11 for pytorch3d; this one has no reason to
move. That is what the split buys.

    """Place anatomical landmarks on a CBCT scan.

    Args:
        input: One CBCT scan (.nii/.nii.gz/.nrrd/.nrrd.gz/.gipl/.gipl.gz), or a
            folder of them for a batch. Folders are searched recursively, and a
            DICOM series found inside one is converted automatically. An input
            holding intraoral surfaces is refused by name rather than half
            processed -- run ALI_IOS on those.
        model: The model bundle, holding `<landmark>/<scale>/*.pth` folders.
        output_dir: Where results are written -- one `<scan>_lm_<ID>.mrk.json`
            per scan, mirroring the input's own folder tree, plus
            `run_report.json`. Nothing is written outside it.
        regions: Anatomical regions to predict. Every region is on by default:
            a landmark whose weights the bundle lacks costs a line in the run
            report, whereas a region left off by default is one nobody finds.
        landmarks: Predict exactly these landmarks. Leaving it empty is the
            ordinary case and hands the choice to `regions`; naming any
            landmark here REPLACES the region selection rather than narrowing
            it, which is what lets a caller ask for the seven points it needs
            instead of running 58 agents to use them.
        prediction_ID: Suffix used in output names, e.g. `scan_lm_Pred.mrk.json`.
        device: "cuda" or "cpu". CUDA falls back to CPU when no card is
            visible, with a warning.
        search_seconds: Seconds one agent may spend looking for its landmark
            before it is reported as not found. 0 uses the default for the
            device in use -- 15 s on CUDA, 60 s on CPU -- since there is no
            nullable type in the schema to express "unset" with.

    Returns:
        The output directory, holding the markups files and the run report.
