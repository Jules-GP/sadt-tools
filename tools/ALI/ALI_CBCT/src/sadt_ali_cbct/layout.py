"""How a client should lay this tool's panel out. Presentation only.

Nothing here changes what `run()` accepts -- `describe.py` merges these hints
into the published schema and refuses any that name an argument or an option
the signature does not offer. Delete this file and the tool still works; the
panel just gets worse.

**Everything is DERIVED, never restated.** That is the whole difference from the
`ArgSpec` tables this replaces. Those listed the anatomical tabs by hand, and a
landmark added to the catalog was then reachable through no tab at all -- offered
by the schema, invisible in the UI. Here the tabs are computed from
`catalog.GROUP_LABELS`, so a landmark added there appears in its tab with no
edit here and no client release.

Why it is needed at all: this tool publishes **119** landmark options. A schema
that says "119 strings, pick some" is honest and produces a panel nobody can
use.

No `visible_when` anywhere, and that is the split showing through. It used to
carry seven rules whose whole job was hiding the intraoral half of a shared
schema; there is no intraoral half here any more, so every argument in this
panel applies to every run of it.
