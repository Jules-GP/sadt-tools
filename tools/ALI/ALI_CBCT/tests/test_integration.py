"""ALI as the server actually invokes it: out of process, in its own venv.

Two things are only testable from out here:

* that the tool writes nothing outside `output_dir`. In-process the test shares
  a working directory with the tool, so a stray write lands somewhere the test
  was going to create anyway; `run_tool` runs it from a neutral directory.
* that the published schema and the callable agree. The server reads the schema
  and calls `run(**params)` from it, so an argument renamed in one place and not
  the other breaks the chain there, not here -- unless something checks.

The `Crown_Seg -> ALI` chain below is the real handoff, not a fixture standing
in for one: ALI's IOS engine needs meshes carrying tooth labels, and Crown_Seg
is what puts them there. It used to happen inside ALI, through an in-process
import; the server sequences the two now, and this is what says the seam still
fits. It skips unless both tools are built with their heavy extras -- see
tests/data/README.md.
