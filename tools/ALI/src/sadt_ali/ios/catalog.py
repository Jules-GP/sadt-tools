"""The IOS landmark vocabulary: teeth, landmark types, and the networks.

Three networks exist, and each predicts a fixed set of landmark types on a
tooth it is pointed at:

* **Occlusal** (`O`) -- the occlusal point plus the mesio- and disto-buccal
  cusps (`O`, `MB`, `DB`);
* **Cervical** (`C`) -- the cervical lingual and buccal points (`CL`, `CB`);
* **Mucogingival** (`MG`) -- one point per lower tooth, on the gingival margin
  rather than on the crown. It exists so a caller can register a mandible on
  the band around the mucogingival line without predicting those landmarks
  somewhere else first.

`R`, `RIP` and `OIP` were offered by the Slicer UI and are deliberately absent
here: no shipped model predicts them, and ticking them did nothing at all.
