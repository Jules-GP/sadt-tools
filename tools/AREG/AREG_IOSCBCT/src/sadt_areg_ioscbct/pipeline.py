"""Pair an intraoral scan with a CBCT of the same patient, and register it.

NOT longitudinal, unlike its two siblings. AREG_CBCT and AREG_IOS take a
baseline and a follow-up of one modality; this takes ONE timepoint imaged two
ways, and puts the intraoral scan into the CBCT's frame. Upstream's own test
set says so plainly -- `P001_T2_U.vtk` beside `P_0001_T2.nii.gz`, both T2.

That is why the arguments are `ios` and `cbct` rather than `t1` and `t2`, and
why `pairing.pair()` is not what pairs them: there is no timepoint to strip,
only a patient to match across two naming conventions.
