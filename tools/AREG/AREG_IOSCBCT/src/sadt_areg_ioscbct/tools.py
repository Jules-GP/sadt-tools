"""How this tool reaches the four it depends on, through the supervisor.

AREG_IOSCBCT predicts nothing itself. The landmarks it registers on come from
ALI_CBCT and ALI_IOS, the tooth labels from Crown_Seg and the orientation from
ASO -- each in its own virtualenv, started as a subprocess by the supervisor.
That is what lets this tool drive an engine pinned to torch 2.8 and another
pinned to 2.11 while depending on neither.

**Tools are named by string, never imported.** A tool cannot import another --
separate virtualenvs are the reason the split exists -- so the name is a free
string, and `describe.py` reads THIS FILE to publish the `calls` list the server
checks at startup. Which is why the calls live here rather than in
`../common/`: shared, they would be invisible to that check.

The mapping from upstream, made deliberately rather than discovered during a
run, because getting it wrong has cost three separate defects already:

    upstream module          this tool asks for
    CrownSegmentationcli     Crown_Seg
    ALI_CBCT                 ALI_CBCT
    ALI_IOS                  ALI_IOS
    PRE_ASO_CBCT   \\
    SEMI_ASO_CBCT   >        ASO, with modality and automation as arguments
    PRE_ASO_IOS    /

Upstream's three ASO variants are three CLI modules; ours is one tool that
takes the mode as data. And note that `ALI_CBCT` / `ALI_IOS` are upstream's own
names -- our merged `ALI` was the anomaly, which is why an earlier
`sup.run("ALI", ...)` was wrong on both sides of the split.
