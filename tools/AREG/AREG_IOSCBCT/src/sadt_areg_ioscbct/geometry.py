"""The registration itself: landmarks first, then a point-to-plane ICP.

Ported from upstream's `AREG_IOSCBCT/AREG_IOSCBCT.py`, which is a Slicer CLI
module. Nothing here predicts anything -- the landmarks, the tooth labels and
the orientation all arrive as inputs, produced by other tools. That is what
lets this tool depend on neither torch nor pytorch3d while driving engines
pinned to both.

Two stages, and the order is load-bearing: the landmark transform puts the two
meshes in roughly the same place so the ICP starts inside its capture range. An
ICP started on unaligned meshes converges to whatever local minimum it happens
to reach.
