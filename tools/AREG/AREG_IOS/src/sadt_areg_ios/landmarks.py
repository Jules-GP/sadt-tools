"""Reading Slicer markups files, and matching one to the scan it belongs to.

AREG only ever READS landmarks -- the mucogingival ones ALI predicts for the
lower arch (see `ios/mgl.py`) -- so this is a reader, not the full markups
module ASO and ALI each carry. Same reason those two are separate: importing
another tool's module at load time makes one tool's missing dependency take
both out of the registry.

The matching is the part worth reading. Upstream's `FindLandmarkFile` fell back
to ANY json whose name merely contains the scan's stem, taking `sorted(...)[0]`
with a warning when several matched -- the same substring defect this codebase
has already fixed twice (`vtk_name in json_name` pairing patient 1 with patient
10; `"cb" in basename` making every CBCT a cranial base). Here it would hand
`P1`'s landmarks to `P10` whenever `P1`'s own file is missing, registering a
mandible against another patient's mucogingival line while reporting success.
Files are matched through `pairing.patient_stem`, the rule that paired the
scans, and an ambiguity is an error naming the candidates.
