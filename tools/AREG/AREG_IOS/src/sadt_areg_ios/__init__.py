"""AREG_IOS -- register a follow-up intraoral scan onto its baseline.

A patch of the arch that does not move with growth or treatment -- the palate,
or the band around the mucogingival line -- matched by ICP.

Split out of the former single `AREG`. The reason is concrete: this engine
needs pytorch3d, which ships as a wheel built against one exact torch
(`+pt2110cu128`), so it is pinned to torch 2.11. The CBCT engine needs neither
and has no reason to move, and while the two shared a virtualenv neither could
be pinned without the other. They now share only `sadt_areg_common`, which has
no dependencies at all.

The tooth labels and the mucogingival landmarks this needs come from other
tools reached through the supervisor; see `tools.py`.

    Args:
        t1: The baseline meshes -- one surface or a folder of them, searched
            recursively. Each must say its jaw in its name.
        t2: The follow-up meshes, paired to T1 by patient key.
        output_dir: Where the registered meshes, their transforms and
            `AREG_report.json` are written. Nothing is written outside it.
        automation: Semi-Automated takes meshes that already carry their tooth
            labels and orientation; Fully-Automated labels and orients them
            first, through the crown-segmentation and orientation tools.
        reference: Fully-Automated only. The orientation reference.
        patch: Which part of the arch to match on -- the palate for an upper
            arch, the band around the mucogingival line for a lower one.
        registration_model: The model that finds the palatal patch. Not used by
            the mucogingival patch, which is built from landmarks and involves
            no network at all.
        crown_model: Fully-Automated only. The checkpoint the crown-labelling
            tool runs with. A mesh that already carries its tooth-label array
            needs none.
        mgl_model: Mucogingival patch only. The landmark bundle the line is
            predicted from, when no landmarks are sent.
        mgl_landmarks: Mucogingival patch only. Your own 13 landmarks per lower
            scan, instead of having them predicted.
        mgl_patch_height: Mucogingival patch only. How far the band extends
            from the line, in millimetres. 0 uses the engine's default.
        output_suffix: Added to each output name, e.g. `scan_Reg.vtk`.

    Returns:
        The output directory.
