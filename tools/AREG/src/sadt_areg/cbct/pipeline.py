"""The CBCT half of AREG: mask the T1 scan to one anatomical region, register
the T2 onto it, write the registered volume and the transform.

Ported from `AREG_CBCT/AREG_CBCT.py` (the driver) and the registration half of
`AREG_CBCT_utils/utils.py`. The Slicer envelope is gone: no `<filter-progress>`
prints, no `time.sleep(0.2)` progress theatre (0.6 s per patient), no
`sys.exit`, and nothing written into the caller's input tree.

Three behaviours are deliberately different from the original:

* **The written `.tfm` is usable.** The original registered the T1 against a
  RECENTRED COPY of the T2 and wrote the transform between those two spaces,
  while that copy lived in a `<t2_folder>_Center` directory next to the user's
  own data and was never returned -- so the one file saying how the scans were
  aligned referred to a volume the caller did not have. There is no recentring
  here (see `elastix._RIGID_PARAMETERS`), so the transform maps the T1 frame to
  the T2 frame the caller sent.
* **The T2 is interpolated once instead of twice.** Recentring resampled every
  moving volume before the registration resampled it again; elastix's
  `AutomaticTransformInitialization` aligns the centres itself, so the first
  pass bought nothing and cost a blur.
* **A registration that cannot be done is reported, not raised.** The original
  caught every per-patient exception into a log line and printed how many had
  failed; the archive gave no clue. Each patient gets a report entry.

    Several roots because a mask can come from three places -- a folder the

    no mask folder was given), or AMASSS's output in the automated modes. The
    first root that has a patient's mask wins, so an explicit mask folder
    always beats one found next to the scans.

    `scan_keys` are the patients the scans were discovered under, and matching
    falls back to the LEAF of a key when the full relative path does not line
    up. It has to: a mask folder a caller sends is rarely laid out like their
    scan folder, and AMASSS's output is never laid out like it -- it writes one
    `<scan>_<id>_SegOut/` directory per scan, so a mask discovered under it
    keys to `P1_seg_SegOut/P1` while its scan keys to `P1`. The fallback is
    only taken when the leaf is unambiguous across the whole tree, so two
    subjects genuinely called `P1` in different folders never borrow each
    other's mask.
