"""The IOS half of AREG: pair two timepoints of intra-oral scans, paint the
stable region on each, align them, move the whole model with it.

Ported from `AREG_IOS/AREG_IOS.py` (the driver, both of its modes) and the
`Sort`/`SortLower` half of `AREG_IOS_utils/dataset.py`.

Which region is stable depends on the arch, and that is the whole design. The
maxilla has the palate, a plateau orthodontic treatment does not move, painted
by a network (`butterfly.py`); the mandible has none, but the band around its
mucogingival line does the same job (`mgl.py`). Picking the patch therefore
also picks which arch is registered:

* **palate** -- the upper arches are registered and the lower ones are carried
  along by the upper's transform, so the captured occlusion survives;
* **mucogingival line** -- the lower arches are registered on their own and the
  upper ones are left untouched, as upstream leaves them: the MG model covers
  the mandible only.

The pairing is rewritten rather than transcribed. `Sort` matched two files by
`os.path.basename(name).replace("T1", "")`, so it paired on base names alone
(two subjects called `Upper.vtk` in different folders became one), mangled a
patient identifier containing the literal `T1`, and defaulted every file that
did not say "Upper" to the LOWER arch. Both timepoints go through
`pairing.patient_stem` here, and a mesh whose name does not say its jaw is
reported rather than guessed.
