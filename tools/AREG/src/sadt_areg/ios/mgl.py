"""The lower arch's registration patch: a band of surface around the
mucogingival line.

Ported from `AREG_IOS/AREG_IOS_utils/mgl_patch.py` in the upstream
SlicerAutomatedDentalTools ("ADD: MGL registration mode for the lower arch in
AREG_IOS", 2026-08), which the Cloud fork the rest of AREG came from predates.

The upper arch is registered on the palate, a plateau orthodontic treatment
does not move, painted by a network (see `butterfly.py`). The mandible has no
such plateau, but it has the mucogingival line where attached gingiva meets
alveolar mucosa: ALI's MG model places 13 landmarks along it, and joined into a
curve and grown into a band they play the same role. The patch is written as a
0/1 point array of the same shape, so the ICP reads it identically.

It needs no network of its own, which is the operational point here: the
palatal patch needs pytorch3d, and this is a spline, a shortest-path walk and a
label lookup. A deployment without pytorch3d answers 501 for the upper arch and
registers lower arches at full speed.

Two properties of the band are load-bearing, and both are the original's:

* every sample of the curve is SNAPPED onto the mesh, because a curve
  interpolated between landmarks floats off the surface in the concavities
  between teeth;
* the band grows GEODESICALLY, never through space, so a buccal patch cannot
  leak onto the lingual side wherever the ridge is thinner than the radius.

Only the implementation of the second differs: `_adjacency` built a Python
`set` per vertex by walking every cell through a `vtkIdList`, millions of
interpreter-level operations for something `postprocess.Adjacency` already
computes in numpy. The Dijkstra walk itself is unchanged.
