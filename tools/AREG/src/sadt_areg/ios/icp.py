"""Rigidly aligning two palatal patches, and writing the result as a transform.

Ported from `AREG_IOS/AREG_IOS_utils/ICP.py` (ICP / vtkICP) and the
`saveMatrixAsTfm` / `read_matrix` half of `transformation.py`.

Two things the originals got wrong, both invisible:

* `vtkICP.__call__` returned its source UNMOVED: it built a
  `vtkTransformPolyDataFilter`, ran it, and returned the input polydata,
  throwing the filter's output away. `ICP.run` fed that into the next entry of
  `list_icp` and multiplied the matrices together, so every method after the
  first ran on unaligned points while its matrix was composed as if it had not.
  Only one method was ever configured, which is why it never showed. There is
  one alignment here and no list to compose.
* `read_matrix` read `GetTranslation()`, which is the whole translation only
  when the centre of rotation is the origin. A transform about any other centre
  maps `y = R(x - c) + c + t`, an offset of `t + c - Rc` -- `GetOffset()` in
  SimpleITK. The two happen to be equal here, ASO writing its transforms
  centred on the origin, so this is the same correction the CBCT engine needed
  for elastix, applied before it can bite rather than after.
