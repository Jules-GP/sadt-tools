"""Pairing a T1 folder with a T2 folder, and finding the masks that go with T1.

AREG's whole input is two timepoints of the same subjects, sent as two folders,
and everything downstream keys off the pairing this module produces. One
implementation shared by both engines: `AREG_CBCT_utils.GetPatients` and the
near-identical copy in `AREG_Method/CBCT.py` had drifted into two signatures
with two different mask rules.

Three defects of those copies are fixed by construction:

* the patient key was a BASE NAME, so `scanT1.nii.gz` in two subfolders became
  one patient, in the working dict and again in the flat output folder. The key
  is the path relative to the input root, and the output mirrors that tree;
* `.split(".")[0]` truncated a name at its first dot, so `P1.2_scan.nii.gz`
  became patient `P1`. Extensions are split off properly, compound ones
  included;
* mask regions were matched as SUBSTRINGS: `"cb" in basename.lower()` makes
  every file whose name contains CBCT a cranial-base mask, `"max"` matches a
  patient named MAX_01 and `"md"` matches almost anything. Matching is on whole
  tokens of the stem.
