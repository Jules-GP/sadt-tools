"""The seam between AREG and the four tools it drives.

AREG registers a T2 onto its T1. Getting there needs work it does not do
itself -- masks around the regions to register on, an orientation both
timepoints share, tooth labels, a mucogingival line -- and each of those is
another tool in this repository. AREG calls them; it does not contain them.

Every call goes through the **supervisor**, the object whatever runs AREG hands
it as the keyword-only `sup`. Nothing here imports another tool: they have
different interpreters and irreconcilable dependency sets, which is the whole
reason the split exists. `sup.run("AMASSS", ...)` starts that tool in its own
venv and blocks until it is done.

Three things worth knowing before changing anything here:

* **Tools are named by string, never by attribute.** `sup.run("ASO", ...)`, not
  `sup.ASO(...)`. A typo in a string is greppable and this file is the whole
  call graph; a typo in an attribute is an `AttributeError` an hour into a job.
* **The arguments are the callee's published schema**, not AREG's vocabulary.
  When a tool renames an argument this file is what breaks, which is the point:
  it breaks in one place, with the name in it.
* **A missing supervisor is not a bad request.** Nothing about the caller's
  arguments is wrong -- there is simply no way to reach the other tool. Each
  `require_*` below says which mode to use instead, because that is a real
  answer and "deploy a tool" usually is not.
