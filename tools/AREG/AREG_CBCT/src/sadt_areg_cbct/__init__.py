"""AREG_CBCT -- register a follow-up CBCT onto its baseline.

elastix, rigid, restricted to the anatomy that has not changed between the two
timepoints: the cranial base, the mandible or the maxilla, taken as masks.

Split out of the former single `AREG`, which served both modalities from one
schema and one virtualenv. The reason is the same as ALI's: the intraoral
engine needs pytorch3d and therefore torch 2.11, this one needs neither, and
while they shared an environment neither could be pinned without the other.
They now share only `sadt_areg_common` -- the patient-key convention, the
catalogs, and the scan-extension table -- which has no dependencies at all.

The masks this registers on, and the orientation both timepoints must share,
come from other tools reached through the supervisor; see the CBCT half of
`tools.py`. `AREG_CBCT -> ASO -> ALI_CBCT` is the deepest chain in the family.

    Args:
        t1: The baseline scans -- one volume or a folder of them, searched
            recursively. A DICOM series is converted when `dicom_input` is set.
        t2: The follow-up scans, paired to T1 by patient key.
        output_dir: Where the registered scans, their transforms and
            `AREG_report.json` are written. Nothing is written outside it.
        automation: Semi-Automated takes your own masks; Fully-Automated
            segments them; Oriented + Fully-Automated orients both timepoints
            first, which needs a reference.
        regions: The anatomy to register on -- what has NOT changed between the
            timepoints. The one argument a clinician must actually think about.
        t1_masks: Semi-Automated only. Your own T1 segmentation masks.
        segmentation_model: The mask model bundle, for the modes that segment.
        segmentation_label: Which label value in the masks to register on.
        reference: Oriented + Fully-Automated only. The orientation reference.
        landmark_model: Oriented + Fully-Automated only. The landmark bundle the
            orientation step predicts with.
        dicom_input: The inputs are DICOM series rather than volumes.
        output_suffix: Added to each output name, e.g. `scan_Reg.nii.gz`.

    Returns:
        The output directory.
