    """Label every tooth of an intraoral scan with its dental number.

    Args:
        meshes: One intraoral surface (.vtk/.stl), or a folder of them for a
            batch. Folders are searched recursively and the output mirrors the
            input tree, so two patients whose meshes share a file name stay
            apart.
        model: The crown-segmentation checkpoint (a .pth file).
        output_dir: Where the labelled meshes are written, plus
            `run_report.json`. Nothing is written outside it.
        array_name: Name of the point-data array the labels are written to.
        suffix: Added to each output name, e.g. `arch_Seg.vtk`.
        numbering: Universal or FDI tooth numbering. This changes the integers
            written into the array, not the mesh, and whatever consumes the
            result has to agree — the report records which was used.
        skip_segmented: Pass a mesh that already carries labels through
            unchanged instead of spending minutes re-predicting it. That is
            what makes a mixed batch of raw and pre-segmented meshes one call.
        device: "cuda" or "cpu". CUDA falls back to CPU when no card is
            visible, with a warning.
        num_workers: DataLoader workers shapeaxi uses to load meshes. Forced to
            at least 1: shapeaxi builds its loader with persistent_workers=True,
            which PyTorch rejects at 0.

    Returns:
        The output directory, holding the labelled meshes and the run report.
        The report lists every mesh that now carries labels under
        `segmented_meshes` — that is what a caller sequencing this before ALI
        reads.
