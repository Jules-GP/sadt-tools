"""Emit the JSON schema the server publishes for a tool, read from its run().

Run it with the tool's OWN interpreter, because importing the tool needs the
tool's dependencies and nothing in this repository shares an environment:

    tools/AMASSS/.venv/bin/python scripts/describe.py tools/AMASSS

The signature is the single source of truth. There is no second declaration to
keep in step, which is the whole reason the old `ArgSpec` tables are gone: they
drifted from `run()` and the client rendered widgets the tool did not have.

This script deliberately FAILS (exit 2) on anything it cannot represent rather
than emitting a plausible-looking schema. A wrong schema is worse than no
schema: the client builds its form from it, and a silently dropped argument
becomes a run that succeeds with the wrong parameters.

It stays compatible with Python 3.9 -- a tool may pin an old interpreter, and
this must run inside it -- so no tomllib and no match statement here.
