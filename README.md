# sadt-tools

One isolated Python project per SlicerAutomatedDentalTools tool. Each has its
own interpreter, its own virtualenv and its own lockfile, and they never import
each other.

This repository contains **no server code**: no HTTP, no FastAPI, no
authentication, no data store. A tool here does not know it is being served.

## Why the tools are isolated

Because the shared environment they came from does not resolve. In the upstream
extension every module installs into 3D Slicer's Python interpreter and into
ad-hoc conda environments, which produces conflicts that are reproducible today:

- `SurgMovPred` runs `pip_install("numpy==2.4.0")`; `AREG`, `MedX` and `CLIC`
  pin `numpy<2.0.0`. Whichever module runs last breaks the others.
- Two different conda environments are both called `shapeaxi`: Python 3.9 in
  `ALI`/`ASO`/`AREG`/`FlexReg`, Python 3.12 in `DOCShapeAXI`. Creating the
  second silently overwrites the first.
- `monai` resolves to 1.3.2 or 0.7.0 depending on the interpreter's Python.
- `torch` is pinned to 2.2.0 in AMASSS/ASO/AREG/MRI2CBCT/CLIC, unpinned
  elsewhere, and `MRI2CBCT` forces the cu118 build.

None of that is fixable by picking better versions, because the versions are
part of the science: the same weights on a different torch can produce different
masks. So each tool keeps the pins its results were produced with, and disk cost
is handled by deduplication at build time rather than by convergence.

## Where things live

| Repository | What is in it | Open it to |
|---|---|---|
| [slicer-remote-tool-server](https://github.com/Jules-GP/slicer-remote-tool-server) | The generic HTTP server: routes, auth, dispatch, the runner, the `/DATA` store. Knows nothing about dental tools. | Change the API, authentication, job handling or deployment. What it has to do to serve these tools is written down in [docs/SERVER_CONTRACT.md](docs/SERVER_CONTRACT.md) |
| **sadt-tools** (this one) | One isolated project per tool. Knows nothing about the server. | Change what a tool computes, or the versions it computes it with |
| [SlicerAutomatedDentalToolsCloud](https://github.com/Jules-GP/SlicerAutomatedDentalToolsCloud) | The thin 3D Slicer client. Discovers everything through `GET /tools`. | Change the user interface |
| [SlicerAutomatedDentalTools](https://github.com/DCBIA-OrthoLab/SlicerAutomatedDentalTools) | Upstream. The origin of every algorithm here. | Check what a port was ported from |

## The interface

A tool package exposes exactly one public callable, `run`. There is no base
class to subclass, no registry to edit and nothing to import from the server:

```python
from pathlib import Path

def run(
    scan: Path,
    model: Path,
    output_dir: Path,
    structures: list[str] = ["Mandible", "Maxilla"],
    crop: bool = False,
) -> Path:
    """Segment craniofacial structures on a CBCT scan."""
    import torch          # heavy imports go INSIDE run(), never at module level
    ...
    return output_path
```

The server runs it out of process, one interpreter per tool:

```
/tools/<name>/.venv/bin/python /opt/sadt/runner.py --job /jobs/<uuid>/job.json
```

`runner.py` ships with the server, so runner and server are always the same
version and there is no cross-repo skew to manage. That is also why there is no
shared `sadt-core` package: adding one would put a version of *ours* inside
every tool venv, and it would solve a problem that does not exist.

The full set of rules — annotations, defaults, batch inputs, where output may be
written — is in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). `tools/_template/` is a
working example of all of them.

└── ...
```

`testkit/` holds `sadt-testkit`, a **development-only** package that lets one
tool's tests run another through that tool's own venv, as a subprocess. It is
how a tool whose input is another tool's output gets tested against the real
thing without importing it. See [testkit/README.md](testkit/README.md).

## Scripts

`scripts/describe.py` emits the JSON schema the server publishes for a tool,
read from `run()`'s signature — so the schema cannot drift from the code. It
runs with the tool's own interpreter, because importing a tool needs the tool's
dependencies:

```console
$ tools/_template/.venv/bin/python scripts/describe.py tools/_template
{
  "name": "_template",
  "description": "Summarise the intensity distribution of a scan or a folder of scans.",
  "arguments": {
    "scans":      {"type": "path", "required": true},
    "output_dir": {"type": "path", "required": true},
    "metrics":    {"type": "list[str]", "required": false, "default": ["mean", "max"],
                   "choices": ["mean", "max", "min", "std"]},
    ...
  },
  "returns": "path",
  "source_hash": "96ab3611..."
}
```

An argument annotated `Literal[...]` publishes its options as `choices`, so the
client can render a picker without a second declaration to keep in step —
`list[Literal[...]]` for several-of, a bare `Literal[...]` for exactly-one.

It exits 2 on anything it cannot represent rather than emitting a schema that is
almost right; `source_hash` is what lets the server notice a cached schema has
gone stale.

`scripts/audit.py` reports the distinct torch and Python versions across the
tools and what each costs on disk:

```console
$ uv run scripts/audit.py
torch  2.2.0 (5 tools) | 2.4.1 (2) | unpinned (3)
python >=3.11 (4) | >=3.9,<3.10 (6)
```

It is a diagnostic and only ever reads. Aligning a pin is a human decision that
requires revalidating the model's outputs first.

`scripts/run_tool.py` runs a tool from the command line, in its own venv, and
chains to other tools when one asks for it. The parser is built from `run()`'s
signature, so there is no per-tool CLI to keep in step with anything:

```console
$ python scripts/run_tool.py ALI --input scan.nii.gz --model bundle/ \
      --output-dir out/ --landmarks Ba S N
out/

$ python scripts/run_tool.py ASO --input cohort/ --reference gold/ \
      --output-dir out/ --automation Fully-Automated --landmark-models bundle/
[sup] 20% predicting landmarks with ALI
[sup] running ALI
out/
```

The second command is the whole point: ASO needs landmarks mid-run, so it is
given a **supervisor**, and `sup.run("ALI", ...)` re-enters this same script with
ALI's interpreter. Chaining and nesting are the same recursion — `AREG → ASO →
ALI` would be three levels of it with no special case.

**Developer convenience, not the deployment path.** In production the server's
runner does this. It is also the shortest readable reference for what a
supervisor has to be: five members, duck-typed, nothing shared.

## Getting started

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh   # if you do not have uv

cd tools/_template
uv sync          # build .venv from uv.lock
uv run pytest    # runs run() end to end
```

## Provenance

[PROVENANCE.md](PROVENANCE.md) records, for every tool, the upstream path and
commit it was ported from and whether the algorithm was modified. That table —
not this repository's commit history — is what tells you six months from now
whether a result came from upstream code or from something we changed.
